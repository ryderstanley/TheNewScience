\section{Introduction}

   Looking back at the Russian Revolution in 1917 you can see the clear three factions of Marxist thought. Leninism (often referred to as Marxism-Leninism), Trotskyism, and Stalinism. Those three Ideologies were always viewed as absolutely conflicting ideals, however the ideals of Trotskyism and Leninism are compatible contrary to the belief of even academics. Through this mixture of these two ideolgies we can form an Ideal Ideology that in the modern day will actually apply to \emph{most} western nations. Through the New Science of Marxism-Leninism-Trotskyism. \par 
   
\section{Marxism v. Leninism v. Trotskyism}
	
	Before we can explain what this new science is we must first dissect the three ideologies that make it up. \par
	First, we must discuss arguably the most important ideology with in it, we must dissect what is Marxism. Marxism put simply is a Scientific Socialist way of viewing society, the Marxian view of society and history is made up of three important ideas. \par
	1. All of History is that of Class Conflict. \par
	2. Human nature evolves with the material conditions of society. \par
	3. The Bourgeoisie exploits the Proletariat. \par
